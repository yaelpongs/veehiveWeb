          <h2>Veehive Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p class="meta">Last updated: <span id="lastUpdatedPrivacy">2025-10-23</span></p>
        </header>

        <div class="policy-content">
          <p>This Privacy Policy explains how VeeHive collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal data when you use the Veehive mobile application and related services. It applies to renters, car owners, administrators, and visitors. This Policy is tailored for a mobile, peer-to-peer car rental platform operating in the Philippines and aligns with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173) and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR).</p>

          <h3>1. Scope & Roles</h3>
          <p>This Policy covers processing conducted by VeeHive as Personal Information Controller (PIC) and by our Personal Information Processors (PIPs) who process data on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting, authentication, analytics).</p>

          <h3>2. Definitions</h3>
          <p>Personal data, sensitive personal data, processing, PIC, PIP, data sharing, and outsourcing have the meanings set under RA 10173 and its IRR. "Service" means the Veehive app, website, APIs, and admin dashboard.</p>

          <h3>3. Lawful Bases for Processing</h3>
          <p>We process personal data only when one or more lawful bases apply: (a) consent; (b) contractual necessity (e.g., bookings); (c) compliance with legal obligations; (d) legitimate interests (e.g., fraud prevention, platform security) balanced against your rights; (e) vital interests; or (f) other bases provided under RA 10173 and its IRR.</p>

          <h3>4. What We Collect</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Account data: name, email, phone, password hashes, profile photo; optional Google sign-in identifiers.</li>
            <li>Identity & verification: driver’s license photos (front/back/with owner), OR/CR documents, and related metadata.</li>
            <li>Listing & booking data: car make/model/year, photos, location/address, availability, rates, booking history, cancellations, refund status.</li>
            <li>Communications: in-app chat messages, timestamps, status (sent/delivered/read).</li>
            <li>Location/GPS: approximate geolocation for nearby cars and navigation.</li>
            <li>Device & usage: app versions, logs, crash data, cookies or SDK identifiers, notification tokens.</li>
            <li>Ratings/reviews and reports: text feedback, stars, report tickets.</li>
            <li>Admin actions: approvals, flags, compliance notes.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5. How We Use Personal Data</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Create and manage accounts, verify identities, and approve listings;</li>
            <li>Facilitate search, booking, messaging, notifications, and navigation;</li>
            <li>Prevent double-booking and fraud, enforce rules, and resolve disputes;</li>
            <li>Operate, secure, and improve the platform (including debugging, analytics);</li>
            <li>Comply with laws, respond to lawful requests, and exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>6. Data Sharing, Outsourcing & Processors</h3>
          <p>We use trusted service providers (e.g., cloud hosting, authentication, storage, maps, emails/notifications) under contracts that require confidentiality, security, and data protection. Data sharing with third parties occurs only for legitimate purposes, with appropriate safeguards, and in accordance with RA 10173 and the IRR. We maintain records of processing and data sharing agreements where applicable.</p>

          <h3>7. Cross-Border Transfers</h3>
          <p>Where personal data is processed or stored outside the Philippines (e.g., cloud services), we implement contractual safeguards consistent with NPC Advisory No. 2024-01 on Model Contractual Clauses (MCCs) and remain accountable for such transfers. We ensure appropriate organizational, physical, and technical measures accompany the data.</p>

          <h3>8. Retention</h3>
          <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary for the stated purposes and to meet legal, accounting, and security requirements. We apply defined retention schedules (e.g., booking records retained [X] years; account data retained until deletion plus [Y] months for audit; verification images retained for [Z] months unless required by law).</p>

          <h3>9. Security Measures</h3>
          <p>We implement organizational, physical, and technical safeguards appropriate to the risks (e.g., access controls, encryption in transit and at rest where applicable, role-based permissions, audit logs, vulnerability management). We follow RA 10173 IRR Rule VI and relevant NPC circulars.</p>

          <h3>10. Your Data Subject Rights</h3>
          <p>Subject to limitations under RA 10173, you have the right to be informed, to object, to access, to rectification/correction, to erasure or blocking, to damages, to data portability, and to file a complaint with the NPC. You may exercise these rights through in-app settings or by contacting us (Section 16).</p>

          <h3>11. Children’s Data</h3>
          <p>Our Service is intended for adults. We do not knowingly process children’s personal data for car rental transactions. Parents/guardians may exercise rights on behalf of minors, consistent with RA 10173 and NPC guidance.</p>

          <h3>12. Cookies, SDKs & Tracking</h3>
          <p>The app and website may use cookies/SDKs to provide core functionality (auth, notifications), remember preferences, and measure performance. You can manage certain tracking through device or browser settings. Some features may not function without these technologies.</p>

          <h3>13. Automated Decisions & Profiling</h3>
          <p>We may use limited automated checks (e.g., availability scheduling, fraud flags) to protect users and ensure platform integrity. No solely-automated decisions producing legal or similarly significant effects will be made without appropriate safeguards, transparency, and appeal mechanisms.</p>

          <h3>14. Personal Data Breach</h3>
          <p>If a personal data breach likely to result in a real risk of serious harm occurs, we will notify the NPC and affected data subjects within 72 hours upon knowledge or reasonable belief, consistent with RA 10173 IRR Rule IX. We maintain a Security Incident Management Policy and a response team.</p>

          <h3>15. Third-Party Links & Services</h3>
          <p>Third-party services (e.g., sign-in, maps) have their own policies. We are not responsible for their practices. Review those policies before use.</p>

          <h3>16. Contact Details</h3>
          <p>Data Protection Officer (DPO): [Full Name]<br>
          Email: [privacy@company]<br>
          Address: [Registered Address]<br>
          Phone: [Number]</p>

          <h3>17. Changes to This Policy</h3>
          <p>We may update this Policy to reflect legal, technical, or business changes. Material updates will be notified via email/in-app. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>

          <h2>Veehive Dispute Resolution & Claims Policy</h2>
          <p class="meta">Last updated: <span id="lastUpdatedDispute">2025-10-23</span></p>
        </header>

        <div class="policy-content">
          <p>This Policy explains how disputes and claims are handled between Renters, Owners, and [Company Legal Name]. It complements the Terms of Service (§17) and applies to cancellations, refunds, damages, violations, and conduct issues on the Veehive platform.</p>

          <h3>1) Scope</h3>
          <p>Covers disputes arising from bookings, vehicle condition, delays, cancellations, refunds, damage claims, tolls, fines, and platform rule violations.</p>

          <h3>2) Evidence & Documentation</h3>
          <p>Submit relevant evidence via the app within [X] days: booking details, photos/videos (pickup/return), chat logs, receipts, police or incident reports, OR/CR/insurance copies, and any witness statements.</p>

          <h3>3) Initial Resolution (Owner ↔ Renter)</h3>
          <p>Parties must first attempt good-faith resolution via in-app chat within [48] hours of issue discovery, keeping communications civil and factual.</p>

          <h3>4) Platform Case Management</h3>
          <p>If unresolved, open a case: [Help → Disputes]. Our Support Team will review submissions, may request further evidence, and issue a platform decision based on policies and available facts.</p>

          <h3>5) Cancellations & Refunds</h3>
          <p>Cancellation windows, fees, and refund eligibility are defined by platform rules and Owner listing terms. Refunds may be adjusted for usage, time elapsed, and demonstrable costs. Chargebacks will be contested with evidence where applicable.</p>

          <h3>6) Damage & Incident Claims</h3>
          <p>Owners must promptly report alleged damage with timestamped photos/videos and a repair estimate. Renters should document pre-existing conditions at pickup. Our decision may apportion responsibility, require mitigation, or escalate to insurance/law enforcement as appropriate.</p>

          <h3>7) Fines, Tolls, and Violations</h3>
          <p>Renters are generally responsible for traffic fines, tolls, and violations incurred during the rental. Owners must provide evidence (e.g., official notices). The platform may facilitate pass-through charges or refunds where justified.</p>

          <h3>8) Safety & Misconduct</h3>
          <p>Reports of unsafe driving, harassment, fraud, or illegal acts may result in suspension/termination and referral to authorities. We may restrict access while a case is investigated.</p>

          <h3>9) Privacy in Disputes</h3>
          <p>We limit dispute-related data access to authorized staff and use information solely for resolution, compliance, and legal defense. See Privacy Policy for your rights and breach notification procedures.</p>

          <h3>10) Mediation</h3>
          <p>If platform resolution is unsatisfactory, parties agree to attempt mediation for at least 30 days under [Institution/Rules], at a mutually convenient date and venue. Costs are shared unless otherwise agreed.</p>

          <h3>11) Arbitration (Binding)</h3>
          <p>Persistent disputes shall proceed to confidential binding arbitration under RA 9285 before a single arbitrator (e.g., PDRCI). Seat: [City], Philippines. The arbitrator may order interim measures and allocate costs. Class/representative actions are not permitted unless required by law.</p>

          <h3>12) Small Claims & Law Enforcement</h3>
          <p>Parties may pursue small claims or file police reports where appropriate. Arbitration clauses do not prevent urgent injunctive relief or statutory enforcement.</p>

          <h3>13) Timelines</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Report issues: within [48] hours of pickup/return or discovery.</li>
            <li>Submit evidence: within [7] days of case opening.</li>
            <li>Platform decision: typically within [3] business days after evidence is complete.</li>

            <li>Arbitration: filed within [30] days after failed mediation, subject to applicable limitation periods.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>14) Changes & Contact</h3>
          <p>We may update this Policy. Material changes will be notified. Contact: [support@company] / [legal@company].</p>

          <h3>17) Binding Arbitration & ADR</h3>
          <p>Except for injunctive/statutory relief, disputes shall be resolved by confidential binding arbitration under RA 9285 (ADR Act) before a single arbitrator under [Institution Rules, e.g., PDRCI].
